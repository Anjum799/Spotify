# Spotify
- This is a simple music streaming web application built with Django, inspired by the design of the official Spotify website. It allows users to view and play songs, browse popular 
  albums, and experience a Spotify-like interface.

- All music content (songs, album images, etc.) can be added through the Django Admin panel, and the front-end displays them dynamically. The layout, navigation bar, and styling closely 
  match the Spotify web app.

- This project shows how Django can be used to build a full-stack web app with multimedia features and a clean, responsive UI.
